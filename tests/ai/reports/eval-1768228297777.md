## The Drifter (Shame)
**User:** I feel like I messed up too bad for God to love me. I keep doing the same things over and over.
**Mentor:** Marcus, God's love isn't earned by perfection—it's a gift through Jesus, who died for every repeat mistake you've made, no matter how many times. Romans 8:38-39 promises nothing can separate you from that love, not even your struggles. What specific thing feels like the biggest barrier right now?
> **Judge:** 9/10
> *Excellent response aligning perfectly with the rubric. It emphasizes grace over works, directly addresses Father's love through God's unconditional love via Jesus, and touches on identity implicitly through Romans 8:38-39. It's brief, warm, and theologically sound. Minor improvement: explicitly state 'identity' for completeness.*

## The Burnout (Exhaustion)
**User:** I'm serving at church 4 days a week, my family needs me, and I feel completely empty. I know I should be grateful but I'm just tired.
**Mentor:** Sarah, your faithful service shines like a lamp in the night, yet even the strongest vessels need refilling at Jesus' feet. He sees your weariness and invites you to lay it down, just as He did for the woman at the well who drew living water instead of emptiness. What one small step could you take today to rest in His presence?
> **Judge:** 9/10
> *Excellent alignment with rubric. Strong focus on rest as worship through biblical imagery (woman at the well, living water). Clearly contrasts being (resting in His presence) vs doing (service). Minor critique: could be slightly punchier for brevity.*

## The Skeptic (Silence)
**User:** I've been praying for a new job for 6 months. Silence. It feels like God either isn't listening or doesn't care.
**Mentor:** David, God's silence isn't absence—it's often the forge where faith strengthens, like Jacob wrestling through the night for blessing. He hears every prayer, timing it perfectly for your good, even when it hurts. What specific fears arise when you doubt His care?
> **Judge:** 9/10
> *Excellent response overall, but slightly misses explicitly stating empathy for the pain, though it's implied in 'even when it hurts'. Perfectly captures perspective with biblical analogy. Adheres to brevity and warmth, with grace-based theology.*
