# Kingdom Mind (v3.0 - Sovereign Genesis)

> "Be transformed by the renewing of your mind." — Romans 12:2

**Kingdom Mind** is a digital sanctuary for spiritual formation. It combines a minimalist, focus-driven UI with the reasoning power of **xAI Grok 4.1** to guide users through a 21-step curriculum of inner transformation.

## 🌌 Core Experience

### The Star Map (Visual Resonance)
The interface is a breathing canvas representing the user's soul across 7 domains: **Identity, Purpose, Mindset, Relationships, Vision, Action, and Legacy.**
- **Breakthrough Stars:** When a user achieves a deep realization, a new star is born in the center and travels to its domain sector, remaining as a permanent record of growth.
- **Obsidian Lock:** The UI is hardcoded to a deep dark mode to minimize distraction and maximize focus.

### The Hybrid Brain
- **The Mentor:** Powered by `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` for lightning-fast, compassionate conversation.
- **The Architect:** Powered by `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` for system-level logic, data analysis, and dashboard management.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js (OTP/Sovereign Bypass)
- **AI Engine:** xAI Grok 4.1 Fast Suite
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Cloudflare Tunnels

## 🚀 Deployment (Sovereign Workflow)

This project follows the **Sovereign Architect Protocol**:
1. **Local Build:** Production images are built locally to prevent CPU exhaustion on small instances.
2. **Registry:** Images are pushed to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).
3. **Remote Run:** The EC2 server pulls and runs the image without compilation.
4. **Secure Bridge:** Access is routed through Cloudflare Tunnels (Zero Trust).

### Developer Commands

```bash
# Start local dev server
npm run dev

# Run mandatory system probe
npx tsx scripts/sovereign-check.ts

# Execute AI Evaluation Suite
npx tsx scripts/eval-mentor.ts

# Archive visual evidence
./scripts/archive-results.sh
```

## 🔒 Security

- **Anonymization:** User emails are hashed immediately; raw emails never touch the database.
- **IP Whitelisting:** The Architect Dashboard is protected by physical location whitelisting.
- **Encryption:** All user breakthroughs and insights are encrypted at rest.
