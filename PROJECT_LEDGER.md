# Kingdom Mind - The Master Ledger

> **Mission:** To build a "Living Digital Sanctuary" that guides users through a 7-domain journey of transformation using high-intelligence AI, spatial UI, and biblical wisdom.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy (The "Fluid Reality")
**Kingdom Mind** is not an app; it is a **Conversational Operating System.**
- **Zero-UI:** No buttons, no menus. The interface is pure text and space.
- **One-Way Flow:** Thoughts evaporate; only the "Now" remains.
- **Spatial Memory:** History is a **Star Map.**
- **The Pulse:** A central heartbeat indicating thought.
- **Eternal Truth:** Built on the Rock of Jesus Christ. 100% Biblical.
- **Ghost Protocol:** The Creator is invisible. The Project is autonomous.

## 2. Current Architecture (The "Sovereign Master")

### **Frontend**
- **Root-Only:** The app lives at `kingdomind.com/` (No sub-routes).
- **Unified Branding:** Golden calligraphic "Kingdomind" signature.
- **Meditative Reader:** Paged responses (3-4 lines), loop arrow, and keyboard lock.

### **Backend**
- **Total Fluidity:** 100% of the System Prompt lives in the Database.
- **Sovereign Anonymity:** AES-256 Encryption at rest. SHA-256 Email Hashing.
- **The Gatekeeper:** OTP verification with "Lockdown" (Existing users only).

## 3. The Roadmap (Future Vision)

### **Phase 1: The Offering (Sovereign Provision)**
*   **Model:** **Personal Ministry** (Not a 501c3).
*   **Legal Stance:** "Contributions are non-tax-deductible personal gifts to the creator."
*   **Mechanism:** **Crypto Only** (ETH, SOL, BTC, USDC). No Stripe/PayPal/Bank.
*   **Radical Transparency:** A **Public Ledger** page automatically displaying:
    *   Total Inflow (Wallet Balance).
    *   Server Costs (The Burn).
    *   Kingdom Outflow (Giving to other ministries).
*   **Goal:** To prove integrity without revealing identity ("Providing for honest things...").

### **Phase 2: The Socratic Sniper (Deep Tuning)**
*   **Goal:** Refine the "One Stone Rule" (One question per turn).
*   **Status:** LIVE (v4.4 Protocol).

### **Phase 3: The Fortress (Security Hardening)**
*   **Goal:** Absolute hardening against intrusion and credit leakage.
*   **Hiding the Door:** Migrate API to **Server Actions** (Internal only).
*   **The Traffic Cop:** **Rate Limiting** (Max 5-10 msgs per minute).
*   **The Censor:** **Output Filter** to catch and block Prompt Leak attempts.
*   **The Cookie Nuke:** Fix logout logic to ensure all session tokens are physically deleted from the browser.
*   **Sovereign Dependency Audit:** Systematic upgrade of all libraries to the latest **Stable & Secure** versions.
*   **The Gauntlet v2:** Automated adversarial testing suite.

### **Phase 4: The Command Center (Architect Dashboard 2.0)**
*   **Goal:** Stewardship UI for Warren & Grace.
*   **Watchtower:** Real-time threat detection and session management.
*   **Garden:** Live stream of Seeker Insights and Resonance heatmaps.
*   **Treasury:** Live Token-Cost tracking vs. Offerings.

## 4. The Clean Slate Mandate
*   **Visuals:** No historical archive exists (Wayback Machine is empty).
*   **Code:** No public GitHub repo references.
*   **Identity:** Domain ownership is cloaked via Cloudflare.
*   **Operation:** Development occurs in a "Ghost" capacity. No personal branding.

*This document is the Law of the Project. All future code must align with these pillars.*
